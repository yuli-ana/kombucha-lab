# Project 5 "Kombucha Lab"

"Kombucha Lab" it's an e-commerce app made with React and Firebase database. The app allows user to select favourite Kombucha drink add them to the cart.

**Live site:** https://yuli-ana.github.io/kombucha-lab/

## Project Requirements

- Uses React, and no jQuery
- Uses modular components
- Uses axios and/or Firebase
- React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs!)
- this.state is never directly changed because .setState() is always used to alter state
- App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop-down menu, search field)
- It is clear to the user what the app does
- App and interactions are accessible
- Errors are handled effectively
- Site is live on student's own URL or GitHub Pages

## Best Practise Requirements:

- Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
- Semantic HTML elements are used properly
- All CSS for the site is written in only one CSS file (no inline styles, no separate CSS files for each component, etc). How - you get there is up to you.
- Setup snippet is used
- Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
- Site is responsive and uses media queries
- Files and folders share a naming convention.
